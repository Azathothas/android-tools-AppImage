# android-tools-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of Android Platform Tools (adb, fastboot, etc). 

Turns the released binaries from here into an AppImage: [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, since appimagelauncher is pretty much dead I recommend this alternative: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM

You will need to install android-udev rules or similar packages, they can also be added manually.
