# android-tools-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of Android Platform Tools (adb, fastboot, etc). 

Turns the released binaries from here into an AppImage: [platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)

You can also run the android-tools-appimage.sh script in your machine to make the AppImage.

You will need to install android-udev rules or similar packages for your device, they can also be added manually. 

It is possible that this appimage may fail to work with appimagelauncher, since appimagelauncher is pretty much dead I recommend this alternative: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM
