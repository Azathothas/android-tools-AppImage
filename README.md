# android-tools-AppImage
Unofficial AppImage of Android Platform Tools (adb, fastboot, etc). 

Turns the released binaries from here into an AppImage: [https://github.com/Samueru-sama/android-tools-AppImage](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools)

It is possible that this appimage will fail to work with appimagelauncher, since appimagelauncher is pretty much dead I recommend this alternative: https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM
